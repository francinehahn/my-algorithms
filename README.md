# My Algorithms
Repository that I use to practice the implementation of different algorithms in Javascript.

## Algorithms implemented:
- `Chunked Array`: Given an array arr and a chunk size, return a chunked array
- `Remove Duplicates`: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once
- `Median Of Two Sorted Arrays`: Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays (avoid using the sort method)
- `Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters`: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
- `Reverse Integer`: Given an integer x, return x with its digits reversed (avoid using the reverse method)
- `Smallest Missing Positive`: Given an unsorted integer array, return the smallest missing positive integer (avoid using the sort method)
- `Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock`: Given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, return the maximum profit you can achieve
- `Jump Game`: Given an integer array nums, you are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array
represents your maximum jump length at that position. Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise
- `Substring with Concatenation of All Words`: Given a string and an array of strings, return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in the input string
- `Valid Sudoku`: Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid
- `Game Of Life`: Given a board made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state - live (represented by a 1)
or dead (represented by a 0) - and each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) following four rules, return the updated board
- `Set Matrix Zeroes`: Given an m x n integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's
- `Group Anagrams`: Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together (do not use the split, the sort and the join methods)
