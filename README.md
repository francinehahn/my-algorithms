# My Algorithms
Repository that I use to practice the implementation of different algorithms in Javascript.

## Algorithms implemented:
- Chunked Array: Given an array arr and a chunk size, return a chunked array
- Remove Duplicates: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once
