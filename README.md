# My Algorithms
Repository that I use to practice the implementation of different algorithms in Javascript.

## Algorithms implemented:
- `Chunked Array`: Given an array arr and a chunk size, return a chunked array
- `Remove Duplicates`: Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once
- `Median Of Two Sorted Arrays`: Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays (avoid using the sort method)
- `Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters`: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
- `Reverse Integer`: Given an integer x, return x with its digits reversed (avoid using the reverse method)
- `Smallest Missing Positive`: Given an unsorted integer array, return the smallest missing positive integer (avoid using the sort method)
- `Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock`: Given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, return the maximum profit you can achieve
